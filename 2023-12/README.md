...
In a child theme, the theme.json simply overrides its parent’s theme.json file. In a style variation—and this is where the major difference occurs—the variation’s JSON file overrides the theme.json file and its data is saved to the database.

Once a user selects a style variation of a theme, everything in the variation’s JSON file is treated as a user customization. Essentially, WordPress stores that initial data in the same way as if the user had simply designed the colors, typography, spacing, etc. from the interface. This is an important distinction to make because it means that when you update a style variation in a future theme release, the user will not receive those changes if they have already saved the style variation.

It is possible for users to switch to a variation and switch back to the one they were using to get the update.

Style variations can be a great feature to add to your theme, but they have a specific use case. Sometimes child themes make more sense.
